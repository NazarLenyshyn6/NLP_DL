Final Evaluation:

Your implementation:
Meets many FANG-level expectations: clean design, use of patterns, efficiency, and Pythonic style.
Needs small fixes and robustness improvements to handle edge cases and optimize redundant computation.
Well within reach of a FANG-level intern, but refining edge case handling and ensuring high performance with large datasets will solidify your solution.
